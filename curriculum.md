# Digital Technologies: Structure

## Strands	

* Digital System

    Focuses on the hardware, software and network components of digital systems.

* Data and Information	

    Students initially learn about a range of hardware and software, and progress to an understanding of how data are transmitted between components within a system, and how the hardware and software interact to form networks. 	Focuses on the properties of data, how they are collected and represented, and how they are interpreted in context to produce information. Students learn how data are represented and structured symbolically for use by digital systems, as well as techniques for collecting, managing and organising data that is used to solve problems and create and communicate ideas and information. 	

* Creating Digital Solutions

  	 Explores the interrelated processes and associated skills by which students create digital solutions. Students engage in the four processes of analysing, designing, developing and evaluating. Creating Digital Solutions requires skills in using digital systems and computational, design and systems thinking, and interacting safely by using appropriate technical and social protocols.
     
# Levels 9 and 10 Achievement Standard

By the end of Level 10, students explain the control and management of networked digital systems and the data security implications of the interaction between hardware, software and users.

Students explain simple data compression, and why content data are separated from presentation. They take account of privacy and security requirements when selecting and validating data and use digital systems to analyse, visualise and model salient aspects of data. Students share and collaborate online, establishing protocols for the legal and safe use, transmission and maintenance of data and projects.

Students define and decompose complex problems in terms of functional and non-functional requirements. They design and evaluate user experiences and algorithms, and develop and test modular programs, including an object-oriented program. Students evaluate their solutions and information systems in terms of risk, sustainability and potential for innovation.

# Content Descriptions and Tasks

## [Digital System](http://victoriancurriculum.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Curriculum/ContentDescription/VCDTDS045)

* explaining how an operating system manages the relationship between hardware, applications and system software
* comparing the similarities and differences of two common operating systems based on characteristics such as protection, control, processing and storage
* identifying how changes to the configuration of an operating system change the operation of hardware and software components in a networked digital system
* explaining the role of hardware and software components in allowing people to interact with digital systems, for example using a mouse or touch pad or screen, speech, accelerometer
* investigating the operation and use of robotic process control systems
* explaining encryption of data as a means of protecting data, for example secret keys and ‘exclusive or’ (XOR) and hashing algorithms to digitally sign data


## [Data and Information - Analyse simple compression of data and how content data are separated from presentation](http://victoriancurriculum.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Curriculum/ContentDescription/VCDTDI046)

* explaining how simple compression schemes reduce the size of repetitive data, for example how run length encoding reduces the size of images
* explaining the difference between lossy and lossless compression, for example the difference between JPEG and PNG images
* explaining codecs for audio-visual compression, for example common codecs for video formats
* generating a layout or report in a database or applying a style sheet to a web page

## Web Design

* HTML5 and CSS

Develop techniques for acquiring, storing and validating quantitative and qualitative data from a range of sources, considering privacy and security requirements (VCDTDI047)
