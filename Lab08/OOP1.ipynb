    "Let’s have a go at writing a program using objects. We will use Python’s turtle module, which should be included when you install Python. You can complete almost all of the activities in this course in a web browser by creating a free Trinket account.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to ask Python to import the Turtle class, which is like a blueprint for making a turtle. We will look at what a class is in more detail later on in the course – for now, use this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from turtle import Turtle\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a text editor, save your code as turtle_race.py - or at least ensure you do not call your file `turtle.py` otherwise the code will try to import itself and will not work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will create an instance of a Turtle object. I’m going to name my Turtle object ‘laura’ because I’m going to get my turtle to race against some of the Raspberry Pi team. You can give your turtle whatever name you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "laura = Turtle()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the name of the Turtle object is a variable name, it must start with a letter and it cannot contain any spaces. In fact, we are creating a variable in exactly the same way as we usually do, except that the data type of the variable is not an integer or a string, but a Turtle! We need to give each Turtle object a different name, so that, when we give instructions, we can be specific about which object we are giving the instructions to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s tell our Turtle object what it should look like. Inside the object are attributes, which are pieces of data we can define. The Turtle object has attributes for color and shape, so let’s customise those attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "laura.color('red')\n",
    "laura.shape('turtle')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also tell our Turtle object what to do by calling other methods. With the code below, we are instructing the object to stop drawing with penup(), then to move to a location with goto(), and finally to get ready to draw a line with pendown().\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "laura.penup()\n",
    "laura.goto(-160, 100)\n",
    "laura.pendown()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Save your code and run it. What happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it’s your turn. Create three more instances of a Turtle object, each with a different name. We don’t want to send all of the turtles to the same starting point, so tell one new turtle to goto(-160, 70), one to goto(-160, 40) and one to goto(-160, 10). You can set a different colour for each turtle if you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save and run your code to check that each of your turtles positions itself correctly, ready to start the race!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s add some code to make the Turtle objects race. Below your four turtle objects, add this code, replacing the names (laura, rik, etc.) with the names of your own turtle objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for movement in range(100):\n",
    "    laura.forward(randint(1,5))\n",
    "    rik.forward(randint(1,5))\n",
    "    lauren.forward(randint(1,5))\n",
    "    carrieanne.forward(randint(1,5))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to go back to the top of your program and add this line of code so that we can generate random integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "from random import randint\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as when we used methods to tell the turtle to penup(), pendown(), and goto(), with this code we are calling a method on each turtle object: we are asking it to move forward() a random distance between one and five units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save and run your code and see which turtle wins! The result should be different each time you run the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar version of the code from this section of the course is available as a Code Club project, in case you would like to make it with your learners."
