    "Last week we experimented with creating objects, setting attributes, and calling methods. We started our object-oriented programming journey by using classes that were already written. You can apply what you have learnt so far to create objects defined by any of the numerous free class implementations available on the internet. However, this week you will learn how to write your own classes in order to create custom objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we were designing this course at the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we discussed our experiences of learning about object-oriented programming. We agreed that the way we had learned best was by using objects to write a program that had a visible application, rather than by simply studying the theory of OOP. Therefore, we wanted the result of this course to be a program you can use and interact with in order to experience how objects make it work.\n",
    "Over the next three weeks we will learn how to create an object-oriented text-based adventure game.\n",

    "\n",
    "***Methods*** are the ways in which we interact with an object. For example, we used an on() method to light up an LED in our example from week 1. What methods do you think might be useful for interacting with a room? As an example, we need to be able to display the name of a room when the player enters it, so we might write a get_room() method.\n",

This is a special method to tell Python how to create an object of this class, and it is always called __init__ with a **double underscore** on each side of ‘init’.

We could also store a description of the room to provide some atmosphere – the cellar could be dark and dusty, for instance. Add these attributes to your constructor method like this:\n",

    "# Recap Week 2 \n",
    "\n",
    "This week we looked at writing our own class, instantiating objects of that class with custom attribute values, and using the object’s methods to interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is like a blueprint for creating an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an **object** using our class, we call a special method named the **constructor**. Instantiating an object of a class is a bit like saying, “Hey Python, you remember that blueprint I gave you? Well, I’d like you to use it to make one object.”\n",
    "\n",
    "We need our object to have **attributes** – these are pieces of data stored inside the object. Assigning an object’s attributes is a bit like taking several variables, each with its own name, and grouping them together with the object. So, inside the constructor we define what attributes our object has, and what their starting values will be. In our example, each room object has a name, a description, and a dictionary of rooms linked to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object must also have **methods** – ways for us to tell it what to do. Imagine writing methods as taking several functions, each with its own name, and making them available for use on the object. So, inside the class we define various methods for interacting with the object. In our example, we defined some ‘getters’ and ‘setters’, and also methods to move between rooms and print out the details of each room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, each object we create is called an **instance** of its class, so each room object we made was an instance of Room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next week we will look at using code from classes written by other people, and extending their code to specialise objects for our own purpose. We will look at the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism, and use them in the context of our text-based adventure game to create enemies for the player to encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Glossary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Constructor – a special method to tell Python how to create an object of this class: in Python, the constructor method is always called __init__ with a double underscore on each side of ‘init’\n",
    "* Dictionary – similar to a list, but allows you to give each element a name\n",
    "* Element – one item in a dictionary\n",
    "* Getter – a method whose purpose it is to get a value from within an object (we don't need a method to do it in Python)\n",
    "* Instantiate – create an object of a particular class\n",
    "* Parameter – a way of providing data so that it can be used within a method\n",
    "* self – used within the code for an object to mean ‘this object’\n"
